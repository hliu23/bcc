Welcome to the new website of Brebeuf Coding Club!  

We are meeting on 2nd PRTs Wednesday in Room 121 (in the Dig Cit hallway), and all are welcome to drop in on one of these meetings! There will likely be snacks!  
This website is built and hosted with [Gatsby](https://brebeufcodingclub.gatsbyjs.io/), and its source code is on [Github](https://github.com/hliu23/bcc).
